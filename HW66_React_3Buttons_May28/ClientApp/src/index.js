//Building on what we did in class, create an application that has three buttons.
//On top of the first button, there should be a number.When the button is clicked, the number should increment.
//On top of the second button, have a number as well (should start out as 1).
//This number will be the "increment amount" number, so that when button 2 is pressed, the number on top of it will increment,
//    and this will now be the new amount of how much the first button should increment its number by.

//    E.g.if the user pressed button one, three times, the number on top of it will say "3".
//If the user then presses button two one time, the number on top of it will become "2".
//    Then, if the user presses button one again, instead of its number going up to four, it will go up to five,
//        and then seven etc because the "increment amount" is now set to two.

//        Finally, the third button should change the color of the first number to be a random color every time it is pressed.

//Good luck!
